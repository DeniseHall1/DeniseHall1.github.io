<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>I was most inspired by Squarespace and Toga apartments</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p>Both site used negitative space well and and followed basic design concepts that less is more. They kept it simple and in doing so there was effective use of negative space, size and balance. The focal point was achieved and they captivated the visitor's full attention. The sites were clean and conveyed professionalism and organization.</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

<P>The site are similar in it's use of negative space and are different in balance. Toga apartments was different in its use of movement and changed the negative space background while keeping the focal point the same.</P>
